## Scenario: Executive Escalation – Revenue Volatility & Decision Blind Spots

You have just been appointed as a **Data Intelligence Consultant** for a mid-sized retail company operating across multiple regions.

Over the past six months:

* Revenue has fluctuated unpredictably
* Some products show sudden spikes and drops
* Discounts are increasing but profit margins are unclear
* Regional performance is inconsistent
* Leadership meetings rely on Excel sheets and manual reports

The CEO has made it clear:

> “We are making strategic decisions based on outdated and fragmented data. This stops now.”

The organization needs a **centralized, automated Sales Intelligence System** that transforms raw transactional data into actionable insights and forward-looking forecasts.

You have to deliver a working internal analytics platform.

# The Core Business Problem

### 3️. No Predictive Capability

Leadership cannot answer:

* Are current trends sustainable?
* Should we increase or reduce discounts?

### 4️. No Executive-Ready Reporting

Reports are:
